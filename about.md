My name is Huwenbo Shi. I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health, working with Dr. Alkes Price. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in
[Bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.ucla.edu/) at UCLA in 2018, working with
[Prof. Bogdan Pasaniuc](http://bogdan.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/) in the field of
statistical genetics. Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer
Science also at UCLA in 2013.
