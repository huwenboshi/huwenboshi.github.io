My name is Huwenbo Shi. I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the
[Bioinformatics Interdepartmental Program](http://bioinformatics.ucla.edu/) at
UCLA, working with [Prof. Bogdan Pasaniuc](http://bogdan.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/)
in the field of statistical genetics. In particular, I am developing computational
methods for analyzing large-scale genetic data to understand the underlying
genetic architectures of complex traits. Before starting my Ph.D., I obtained
my B.S. degree in Computer Science also at UCLA.
