### Summary

The paper ``Explaining Missing Heritability Using Gaussian Process Regression" by Sharp et al.
tries to tackle the problem of missing heritability and the detection of interaction effects
through Gaussian process regression, a technique widely used in the machine learning community.
Using Gaussian process regression, the authors obtained estimates of broad-sense heritability
for several phenotypes in mice and yeast, which are significantly larger than the narrow-sense
heritability of these phenotypes.
