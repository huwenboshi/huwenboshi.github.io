### Summary

I am working as a TA for a sequencing algorithm class at UCLA this quarter.(By
the way, if you are a first year PhD student reading this blog post, be sure
to get your TA requirement out of the way as early as possible -- working as a
TA, doing research, and looking for jobs all at the same time is a
nightmare...) Anyway, I post my slides (with animations to illustrate how each
algorithm works) here on the off chance that someone finds them useful.

### [Week 1 -- Python Basics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xgzWxLkI2MGdjLFbPqFLvDPWbgx7kH8B9KdxgO2zYk8/edit?usp=sharing)

...in which I went over basic python syntax, data stucture, and etc.

### [Week 2 -- Burrows-Wheeler Transform](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tnip2fz-r4LetEHXt_7KcXyYV8UAP7lpGcAxtruy5aU/edit?usp=sharing)

...in which I went over how to build a BWT, string reconstruction using BWT,
and FM-index backward search.

### [Week 3 -- Motif Search](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VVt1N22jt5jdyBZZ0Cwo7kR4S8Apg2vVf9BqScXy1wc/edit?usp=sharing)

...in which I went over how to find motifs from a list of DNA sequences.

### [Week 4 -- Graph Basics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bGR2_RV69LE0GNbCGqfl1dIeHRkZc7_rCCXm7GNQ6-o/edit?usp=sharing)

...in which I went over representation of graphs, Hamiltonian cycle, and
Eulerian cycle.

### [Week 5 -- Alignment Algorithms](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nfrXvlpSfeXaxBAS7gQ5U04dCfj91dlPoiXlaKBwyQ8/edit?usp=sharing)

...in which I went over edit distance, Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, and
Smith-Waterman algorithm.

### Conclusion

First years (or maybe second years, third years, and fourth years), get your
TA requirement out of the way as early as possible.
