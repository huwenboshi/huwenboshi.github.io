### Summary

I am working as a TA for a sequencing algorithm class at UCLA this quarter.(By
the way, if you are a first year PhD student reading this blog post, be sure
to get the TA requirement out of the way as soon as possible -- working as a
TA, doing research, and looking for jobs all at the same time is a
nightmare...) Anyway, I post my slides here on the off chance that someone
finds them useful.

### Week 1 -- Python Basics



### Week 2 -- Burrows-Wheeler Transform

### Week 3 -- Motif Search

### Week 4 -- Graph Basics

### Week 5 -- Alignment Algorithms
