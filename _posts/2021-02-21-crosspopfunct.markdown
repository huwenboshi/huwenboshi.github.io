A few days ago, we published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21286-1)
on Nature Communications that looks at the genetics of human diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis)
and complex traits (e.g. height, body mass index) across populations. In this
blog post, I hope to give a simple and intuitive understanding of our work to a broad audience.

### What are we studying?

In this work, we are looking at the effects of genetic variants have on diseases
and traits in different populations. We want to answer two questions: 1) how
similar are the effects of genetic variants in different population


### Why do we care?


### How did we do it?


### What did we find?


### What are the implications?
