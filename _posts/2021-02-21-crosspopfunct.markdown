A few days ago, we published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21286-1)
on Nature Communications that looks at the genetics of human diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis)
and complex traits (e.g. height, body mass index) across populations. In this
blog post, I hope to give a simple and intuitive understanding of our work to a broad audience.

### What did we study?

We studied the effects of genetic variants have on diseases
and traits across different populations. In summary, we wanted to answer the
following questions.

1. How similar/dissimilar are genetic effects across different populations,
across the entire human genome?

2. Where on the human genome are genetic effects  more similar/dissimilar
across populations, compared to the rest of the genome?

The metric we used to assess similarity/dissimilarity in genetic effects
across populations is called trans-ethnic genetic correlation (\\( r_g \\)),
which measures the correlation of genetic effects in different populations.

### Why do we care?


### How did we do it?


### What did we find?


### What are the implications?
