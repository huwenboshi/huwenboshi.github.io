### Abstract

This post talks about linear mixed model -- what it is, how it's fit, and how it's used in genetics.

### Definition

A linear mixed model is a linear model that contains both fixed effects and random effects, and can be expressed as $\textbf{y} = \textbf{X}\mathbf{\beta} + \textbf{Z}\textbf{u} + \mathbf{\epsilon}$, where $\textbf{y}$ is the response variable, $\textbf{X}$ design matrix for the fixed effects $\mathbf{\beta}$, $\textbf{Z}$ design matrix for the random effects $\textbf{u}$, and $\mathbf{Ïµ}$ random noise.

### Fitting algorithms

### Applications in genetics

#### Heritability estimation

#### Genome-wide association studies
